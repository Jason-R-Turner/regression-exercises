This repo is for holding my regression exercises on the Zillow dataset.

It will contain the acquire and prepare functions within the wrangle.ipynb and
wrangle.py files which will be used to obtain and clean up the Zillow database
for use.

I'll be exploring the Zillow database and using regression to make sense of the
information contained within.

User will need their own env.py file for access to the database
