This repo is for holding my regression exercises on the Zillow dataset.

It will contain the acquire and prepare functions within the wrangle.ipynb and
wrangle.py files which will be used to obtain and clean up the Zillow database
for use.

I'll be exploring the Zillow database and using regression to make sense of the
information contained within using the following scenario:

As a Codeup data science graduate, you want to show off your skills to the Zillow data science team in hopes of getting an interview for a position you saw pop up on LinkedIn. You thought it might look impressive to build an end-to-end project in which you use some of their Kaggle data to predict property values using some of their available features; who knows, you might even do some feature engineering to blow them away. Your goal is to predict the values of single unit properties using the obervations from 2017.

User will need their own env.py file for access to the database
